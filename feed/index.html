										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executive Vice Chairman of Globacom, Bella Disu, has been named by Institut Choiseul, a Paris-based organization dedicated to the analysis of contemporary strategic issues and international economic questions, as one of the Choiseul 100 Africa Laureates for 2022.</p>
<p>Choiseul 100 Africa is an annual study conducted independently by the Institut Choiseul to evaluate the work and impact of promising individuals within the period under review. The organisation carries out this study through its various experts and specialists on the continent, resulting in a list of powerful and influential individuals that are reshaping the African economy.</p>
<p>Since 2014 with the launching of the <em>Choiseul Africa</em> initiative, the Institut Choiseul has been willing to promote a positive speech on the African potential in order to bridge the gap between the perception of the continent – particularly from private operators – and the reality on the ground.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Pascal Lorot, the founder and president of the Institut Choiseul, “the <em>Choiseul 100 Africa </em>aims to shed the light upon the young men and women who are successful and have the ambition of lifting Africa its highest level of economical, societal and cultural development”.</p>
<p>Bella Disu, who is a Nigerian business executive, arts enthusiast, author, and philanthropist with over 18 years of professional experience across industries, sits on boards of Cobblestone Properties and Estates Limited as the Chief Executive Officer, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc as a Non-Executive Director, Globacom Limited as the Executive Vice Chairman and Abumet Nigeria Limited as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p><p>The post <a href="https://bella-disu.com/news/bella-disu-ranks-in-choiseul-100-africa-list-for-2022/" target="_blank">Bella Disu Ranks In Choiseul 100 Africa List for 2022</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bella-disu.com/" target="_blank">Bella Disu</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bella Disu Foundation has partnered with The International Women’s Society to establish a chess academy at the IWS Skills Acquisition center, Lekki and Day Nursery School, Yaba. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To support the organization in providing empowerment and educational opportunities to women and children, Mrs Bella Disu made a donation on behalf of her foundation with the objective of improving the potential of children from less privileged backgrounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the guest of honor at the official launch of the chess program, Mrs Disu in her speech said, “Today, I am excited as we partner with two stellar organizations to serve children by establishing a chess program. Since I was a young girl, I have known of the International Women’s Society and its immense impact on the lives of Nigerian women across society. And, of course, like many other Nigerians, I have keenly followed the work done by Chess in Slums Africa over the last year. I have seen photos and videos of your work in Oshodi, but I know that behind the photos are real lives being changed, new dreams being birthed, and great confidence being instilled.”</span></p>

<p>Mrs Disu, who made the donation on behalf of her Foundation, lauded RHF’s efforts in empowering people. In her letter to RHF, she wrote, “At the Bella Disu Foundation, our core objective is to mitigate the many hardships faced by vulnerable Nigerians. One of the ways we do that is by supporting organisations like yours with donations. Your work is commendable, and I hope that this donation goes a little way in supporting you to do more.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the Regalo Hope Foundation used the donation to provide scholarships and educational materials to four primary school students from underprivileged backgrounds. The scholarships will ensure that the beneficiaries — Mmadu Peace, Mmadu Miracle, Kehinde Esther, and Bello Abdullahi — enjoy uninterrupted primary school education at Silver Ridge Children School, Itele, Ogun State. The children were also given uniforms, school bags, sandals, water bottles, textbooks and exercise books as part of the foundations’ efforts to cater to their essential needs and enhance their educational experience.</p>
<p>During the scholarship award, Mrs Chinenye Onuorah, the founder of Regalo Hope Foundation, said, “We are in Ogun State today because there is a need to keep these children in school.”</p>
<p>Mrs Kehinde Esther, the mother of one of the scholarship recipients, thanked the Bella Disu Foundation and Regalo Hope Foundation, adding, “I am very happy for the scholarship you have awarded my daughter.”</p>
<p>In the recent past, the Bella Disu Foundation has also supported other non-profit organisations, including Stand to End Rape Initiative and Women at Risk International Foundation.</p><p>The post <a href="https://bella-disu.com/press-release/bella-disu-foundation-partners-with-regalo-hope-foundation-to-award-scholarships/" target="_blank">Bella Disu Foundation Partners With Regalo Hope Foundation To Award Scholarships</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bella-disu.com/" target="_blank">Bella Disu</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 8, 2020, the International Women’s Day (IWD), the world stood together to say ‘Each for Equal’, encouraging every person to work with others to create a “more equal world”. Beyond being a day of widespread advocacy for women’s rights, it was also one for acknowledging women blazing trails across sectors in the world. This year in Nigeria, the most prestigious IWD recognitions came in form of the Lagos State Governor H.E. Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s commendation of select women making an impact.</p>

<p>In recognition of her influence as a business leader and inspirational woman, Bella Disu, the Executive Vice Chairman of Globacom, was one of the 200 women whose contributions across sectors were highlighted and honoured by Governor Sanwo-Olu under Lagos State’s #Eko4Women initiative.</p>
<p>“On this day, I celebrate you for who you are and what you do, day after day, to create value for the numerous businesses that you oversee, which in turn inspires millions of women across the continent,” Governor Sanwo-Olu wrote to Mrs. Disu.</p>
<p>Mrs. Disu, who sits on the boards of several prestigious companies and is also a philanthropist and founder of the Bella Disu Foundation, shared a photo of the Governor’s letter, adding that she was “incredibly humbled and honoured for the recognition by Mr. Jide Sanwoolu”.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Disu, who was bestowed the Chevalier dans l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in late 2019, Governor Sanwo-Olu’s recognition is yet one more governmental commendation of her hard work and influence.</p><p>The post <a href="https://bella-disu.com/news/iwd2020-bella-disu-amongst-select-women-celebrated-by-the-executive-governor-of-lagos-state-mr-babajide-sanwo-olu/" target="_blank">#IWD2020: Bella Disu Amongst Select Women Celebrated by the Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bella-disu.com/" target="_blank">Bella Disu</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nigeria’s leading, most resilient and reliable engineering construction company, Julius Berger Nigeria Plc has officially launched its new innovative product, the Evonig Glass in Abuja.</p>
<p>Combined with the launch is the commissioning of the state-of-the-art IGU production line at which event guests and specially invited industry and other corporate players had an opportunity to have a first-hand look at some of the latest industrial production facilities and processes at the Abumet factory at Idu industrial area, Abuja.</p>
<p><a ref="magnificPopup" href="https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="538" data-permalink="https://bella-disu.com/press-release/evonig-glass-a-premium-double-glazed-glass-line/attachment/image1-11/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?resize=968%2C650&#038;ssl=1" data-orig-size="968,650" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Adetona Omokanye&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;Canon EOS 5D Mark III&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1583426006&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Adetona Omokanye&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;24&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.004&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="EVONIG GLASS, a premium double-glazed glass line." data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11-300x201.jpeg" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?resize=968%2C650&#038;ssl=1" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-538" src="https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?resize=968%2C650&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="968" height="650" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?w=968&amp;ssl=1 968w, https://i1.wp.com/bella-disu.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image1-11.jpeg?resize=300%2C201&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 968px) 100vw, 968px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Giving his address at the event, the General Manager of Abumet, the top grade metal and glass subsidiary of Julius Berger Nigeria Plc, Mr Tamas Hovart defined Evonig Glass as an industrial acronym which proudly synthesises the two words ‘Evolution’ and ‘Nigeria’.</p>
<p>The product, Tamas said, “is not just an improvement of existing offerings in the Nigerian market; it is a combination of the latest technology and a skilled and committed Nigeria team.”</p>
<p>The Evonig Glass, Tamas further explained, “is a special offering defined by great production quality according to best international standard, innovation, availability, local content and a strong Nigerian workforce, reliable technical partnerships and advanced technology as well as sustainability and reliable after-sales service.”</p>
<p>The General Manager of Abumet, Tamas informed guests at the event that current industrial and procurement estimates of supply to the Nigerian IGU market is put at 90% for imported production and 10% for local production.</p>
<p>This situation, he said, exposes the Nigerian users of the product to a long wait for offshore shipments and prohibitive exposure to foreign exchange challenges. Julius Berger Abumet, Tamas said, “aims to offer comparably faster delivery times for a high quality insulated glass unit solution made in Nigeria with international standards, at a competitive rate.”</p>
<p>The Julius Berger Abumet Evonig glass, offer technical solutions more commonly known as Double glazing, a well-known application in Sub-tropical areas, which consists of two glass panel separated by a vacuum or gas-filled space to reduce heat transfer and noise across a part of the building; and Triple glazing which consists of three-glass panel and two space to achieve greater performance level.</p>
<p>This glazing technology now manufactured in Nigeria by Julius Berger Abumet is highly recommended where the temperature difference between interior and outside spaces is significant so that greater thermal insulation required.</p>
<p>Tamas confidently spoke of the key benefits of using Insulated glass units to include energy savings by which “the insulated glass windows prevent heat loss when it is cold and sustains the cool air when it is hot” This, the Abumet General Manager said, reduces power consumption in a building and saves cost.</p>
<p>The use of Evonig glass with its two glass panes and vacuum space also limits and significantly reduces noise from passing through the building. Tamas happily adds that “it becomes even better when the two panes of glass have various thickness”.</p>
<p>Another key benefit of Evonig glass is that it technically increases the important function of security in a building. With more glass panes, IGU panels become tougher and with a combination of laminated or toughened glass types its get more difficult to break.</p>
<p>The Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, CON was at the event to commission the Julius Berger Abumet Evonig Glass production plant.</p>
<p>The Honourable Minister commended the Julius Berger Group for its initiative to domesticate the novel production of Evonig Glass at the Idu Industrial Area in Abuja Nigeria.</p>
<p>Adebayo who said the President Buhari administration has the vision to create a hundred million jobs in the country in the next decade described the Abumet plant as a worthy job creation initiative. The Honourable Minister gave kudos to Julius Berger for also pioneering the first and most advance fully automated IGU production line in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Hon. Minister described the Abumet production plant as revolutionary to Nigeria’s industrial development. “Keep up your worthy contributions to our strategic national industrial development and growth works”, Otunba Adebayo encouraged Julius Berger.</p>
<p>The alternate Chairman of Abumet, Mr Mahmud Tukur thanked the guests, especially the Honourable Minister, Otunba Adebayo, for finding time to attend the launch of the product and the commissioning of the production plant.</p>
<p>In the excited words of Mahmud Tukur, “Abumet is ready to offer the Nigerian market the greatest deals in terms of best international quality as well as at the most cost-efficient rates. We await the orders of the very discerning Nigerian investors and clientele.”</p><p>The post <a href="https://bella-disu.com/press-release/evonig-glass-a-premium-double-glazed-glass-line/" target="_blank">EVONIG GLASS, a premium double-glazed glass line.</a> first appeared on <a href="https://bella-disu.com/" target="_blank">Bella Disu</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Award, which is in recognition of Mrs Disu&#8217;s remarkable support for arts and culture, especially her coordination of the construction of the iconic Alliance Francaise | Mike Adenuga Centre, Ikoyi, Lagos, was presented to her at a formal ceremony held at the Centre and presided over by the French State Secretary for Education and Youth, Minister Gabriel Attal.</p>
<p>The French Minister, who is the youngest Minister in France, said he was delighted to present the honour to Mrs Bella Disu as the youngest recipient of the French national honour.</p>
<p>The Minister said the unique national honour is reserved for icons who have supported the sustenance and growth of French culture.</p>
<p>He described the Mike Adenuga Centre as magnificent and the most beautiful of all Alliance Francaise centres in the world. He also described the equipment, sound, lighting and technology at the Centre as first class, adding that the project is a cultural revolution.</p>
<p>Facing the Chairman of Mike Adenuga Group, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr who witnessed the ceremony along with the Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the French Ambassador to Nigeria &amp; ECOWAS, Mr. Jérôme Pasquier and other eminent dignitaries, the French Minister said, &#8220;Who could have imagined that it was possible to build such a cultural centre in just a few months? From the very first minute, dear Chairman, you wished that your daughter would lead the project that would facilitate cultural collaborations between French speaking countries and Nigeria.</p>
<p>&#8220;The team worked relentlessly under the attentive but firm supervision of Bella to deliver the building in a record time. It is one of the most exceptional projects of our cultural network and one of the most outstanding examples of arts and culture sponsorships in Nigeria.</p>
<p>&#8220;We owe this exceptional project to you Chairman, who financed it, as much as to Bella who brought it to life,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In a remark on the award, Charles Courdent, Director, Alliance Francaise, Lagos, said the Centre was proud of Mrs Bella Disu&#8217;s uncommon hardwork that gave birth to the Alliance Francaise | Mike Adenuga Centre, adding that &#8220;the vision of Globacom Chairman, Dr. Mike Adenuga has been fully accomplished by his daughter in this project.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her acceptance speech, Mrs Disu expressed gratitude to President Emmanuel Macron of France for the honour. She also thanked her supportive husband, Mr. Jameel Disu, family, friends and all members of the Mike Adenuga Centre project team, particularly the Director who set an audacious vision for the Centre.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thankful for the firm belief that it could be done. Just look at where we are now. The centre has become such a reference point, a cultural hub, promoting French language and culture, showcasing Nigerian talent. We did it and I am proud of the entire project team. I applaud your expertise and tireless commitment&#8221;, she said.</p>
<p>Narrating the hardwork and sleepless nights that birthed the project, Mrs Disu enthused, &#8220;Everyday I went to the site determined to fulfil the vision we had set with the Alliance Française team, I didn’t think anyone was watching. Yet, to be awarded the prestigious Chevalier dans l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres, en Anglais, Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters, has shown me that when you are dedicated and passionate, even when you think no one is watching, today will be the tomorrow you always dreamt of. It&#8217;s been a journey to this honour, but I have not come this far alone. I’d like to thank those who have made it easier for me to stand firm and stand strong on this stage. This award is as much for you. I’d like to thank my father, Dr. Mike Adenuga Jr GCON CSG CDR LH. Thank you, daddy, for your support and for the platform you have given me. Your magnanimity and heart for society continually inspires me…&#8221;.</p>
<p>She described the award as a fulfilment of a dream she had in her sophomore year at the University, concluding that &#8220;today is the tomorrow&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mrs Disu charged all to always do their best on tasks irrespective of whether it was noticed or not, so that their actions will speak for them in rooms where they are not present.</p>
<p>&#8220;I assure you that someone is and one day, today will be the tomorrow you always dreamt of&#8221;, she said.</p>
<p>A business leader who currently serves as Executive Vice Chairman of Globacom, CEO of Cobblestone Properties and Estates, Director at Abumet PLC and non-executive director with Julius Berger, Mrs Disu is a multi-instrumentalist, humanist, patriot and philanthropist. She started playing the Piano at the age of 4 and Saxophone at the age of 18.</p>
