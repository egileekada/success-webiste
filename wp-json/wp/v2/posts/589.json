In her letter to RHF, she wrote, \u201cAt the Bella Disu Foundation, our core objective is to mitigate the many hardships faced by vulnerable Nigerians. One of the ways we do that is by supporting organisations like yours with donations. Your work is commendable, and I hope that this donation goes a little way in supporting you to do more.<\/p>\n<p>In October 2020, the Regalo Hope Foundation used the donation to provide scholarships and educational materials to four primary school students from underprivileged backgrounds. The scholarships will ensure that the beneficiaries \u2014 Mmadu Peace, Mmadu Miracle, Kehinde Esther, and Bello Abdullahi \u2014 enjoy uninterrupted primary school education at Silver Ridge Children School, Itele, Ogun State. The children were also given uniforms, school bags, sandals, water bottles, textbooks and exercise books as part of the foundations\u2019 efforts to cater to their essential needs and enhance their educational experience.<\/p>\n<p>During the scholarship award, Mrs Chinenye Onuorah, the founder of Regalo Hope Foundation, said, \u201cWe are in Ogun State today because there is a need to keep these children in school.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mrs Kehinde Esther, the mother of one of the scholarship recipients, thanked the Bella Disu Foundation and Regalo Hope Foundation, adding, \u201cI am very happy for the scholarship you have awarded my daughter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the recent past, the Bella Disu Foundation has also supported other non-profit organisations, including Stand to End Rape Initiative and Women at Risk International Foundation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In September 2020, the Bella Disu Foundation partnered with Regalo Hope Foundation (RHF), to support the latter\u2019s work in providing educational scholarships and helping underprivileged communities.
