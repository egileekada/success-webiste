Julius Berger Abumet, Tamas said, \u201caims to offer comparably faster delivery times for a high quality insulated glass unit solution made in Nigeria with international standards, at a competitive rate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Julius Berger Abumet Evonig glass, offer technical solutions more commonly known as Double glazing, a well-known application in Sub-tropical areas, which consists of two glass panel separated by a vacuum or gas-filled space to reduce heat transfer and noise across a part of the building; and Triple glazing which consists of three-glass panel and two space to achieve greater performance level.<\/p>\n<p>This glazing technology now manufactured in Nigeria by Julius Berger Abumet is highly recommended where the temperature difference between interior and outside spaces is significant so that greater thermal insulation required.<\/p>\n<p>Tamas confidently spoke of the key benefits of using Insulated glass units to include energy savings by which \u201cthe insulated glass windows prevent heat loss when it is cold and sustains the cool air when it is hot\u201d This, the Abumet General Manager said, reduces power consumption in a building and saves cost.<\/p>\n<p>The use of Evonig glass with its two glass panes and vacuum space also limits and significantly reduces noise from passing through the building. Tamas happily adds that \u201cit becomes even better when the two panes of glass have various thickness\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Another key benefit of Evonig glass is that it technically increases the important function of security in a building. With more glass panes, IGU panels become tougher and with a combination of laminated or toughened glass types its get more difficult to break.<\/p>\n<p>The Honourable Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Niyi Adebayo, CON was at the event to commission the Julius Berger Abumet Evonig Glass production plant.<\/p>\n<p>The Honourable Minister commended the Julius Berger Group for its initiative to domesticate the novel production of Evonig Glass at the Idu Industrial Area in Abuja Nigeria.<\/p>\n<p>Adebayo who said the President Buhari administration has the vision to create a hundred million jobs in the country in the next decade described the Abumet plant as a worthy job creation initiative. The Honourable Minister gave kudos to Julius Berger for also pioneering the first and most advance fully automated IGU production line in Nigeria.<\/p>\n<p>The Hon. Minister described the Abumet production plant as revolutionary to Nigeria\u2019s industrial development. \u201cKeep up your worthy contributions to our strategic national industrial development and growth works\u201d, Otunba Adebayo encouraged Julius Berger.<\/p>\n<p>The alternate Chairman of Abumet, Mr Mahmud Tukur thanked the guests, especially the Honourable Minister, Otunba Adebayo, for finding time to attend the launch of the product and the commissioning of the production plant.<\/p>\n<p>In the excited words of Mahmud Tukur, \u201cAbumet is ready to offer the Nigerian market the greatest deals in terms of best international quality as well as at the most cost-efficient rates.
